But since then, it has evolved into something much greater, and the blockchain has the potential to change the world. Currently, blockchain technology is being used to create digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, developers are now finding other ways to use blockchain technology, including creating smart contracts and developing applications for businesses. As a result, demand for blockchain developer jobs is increasing rapidly. And according to recent reports, blockchain developer salaries are increasing at an even faster rate. So if you’re thinking about becoming a blockchain developer, now is definitely the time to do it! The average blockchain developer salary in the United States is $98,000 per year, and salaries are even higher in some other countries. For example, in Singapore, they earn an average of $140,000 /year. Of course, blockchain developer salaries vary depending on experience, skillset, and location. But even entry-level blockchain developers can expect to earn a salary of $50,000 – $70,000 /year."
